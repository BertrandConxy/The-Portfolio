# Bertrand Mutangana Ishimwe portfolio website.

>This is my portfolio website. It showcases my skills as software developer, experience that I have and the projects that I have worked on as a proof. Moreover, there is a link to download and get my resume. There are links to my social media platforms.

It is a mobile-first layout which is also fully responsive to different screens including desktops and laptops.
