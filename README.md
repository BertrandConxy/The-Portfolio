## How to use and run this project

This is just a webpage and It can be opened in any browser.
It is a mobile version layout which is not yet turned into responsive that is why you will notice that it does not fit the desktop screen.

I have put a live demo link below in the following section so that
if anyone is interested can view it. However, if anyone would like to use it, simply, they can fork the repository and then use it independently.
There are no other dependencies or installations required.
